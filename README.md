# Welcome
Sol is a free language server that teaches students the wonderful variety of languages. In this point in time, we have Chinese, Japanese, Korean, English, Spanish, and German. We are willing to add more languages as we grow. We wish for everyone to experience, and have the knowledge of simple speaking, writing and listening abilities. As well as the knowledge and understanding of the history how each language came to be. You can enter here https://discord.gg/mdQ4pdu to join!!!
